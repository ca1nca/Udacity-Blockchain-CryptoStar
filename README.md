## Cryptostar DApp on Ethereum Project

In this project, we can create a star and look up the name of it by ID. We implemented solidity smart contract functions to transfer a star to a new owner, swap stars with two different users, and look up stars by id. In addition, we wrote Mocha tests to make sure the contract functions worked. Then we implemented the lookup function in index.js before configuring the project for deployment to the Rinkeby Test Network and deploying the smart contract using Infura. Metamask is used to help us facilitate transactions and allows us to run our DApp in our web browser. In addition, we created a new ERC-721 token that we deployed to the Rinkeby Test Network.
